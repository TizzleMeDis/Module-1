# Assignment 1

This html file will be a basic page displaying:
  -  nav bar
  -  table data
  -  also a form for inputing data

## Bonus points

I didn't know how in depth you would like us to go with the css but I tried to just structure it nicely
I utilized flex-box to help with the layout of the content add my second image as an logo for my navigation bar.

The form will also contain the radio buttons along with everything else that was asked in the assignment
